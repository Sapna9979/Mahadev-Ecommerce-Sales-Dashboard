I'm thrilled to present the Mahadev Ecommerce Store Dashboard that I recently created. This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into key metrics, including sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory management, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

🔍 Key Features:
->Sales Analysis: Visualized daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends
->Customer Insights: Detailed customer demographics and purchasing patterns
->Inventory Management: Real-time inventory tracking and restock alerts
->User-Friendly Design: Intuitive and interactive interface for easy navigation

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply my skills in data visualization and analytics, gained through my recent Data Visualization with Python course on Coursera. I used tools like Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to bring the data to life.
